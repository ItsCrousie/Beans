An unpretentious Typescript budgeting app for recurring expenses and shared household costs.

    App Lore

  My partner and I decided early into our relationship that we would share all household expenses 50-50 such that no-one felt either dependant or like a provider.

  I drafted up a quick budget in Google Sheets which worked till about two years into our relationship, constantly adding sheets for the month's household espenses and such go unwieldy.

  I've been in post-secondary education for going on my third year now and I haven't touched web development, TS/CSS/HTML in that entire time being busy with school projects and the likes--BUT running our budget in Sheets has become unsustainable.

  Hence I'm working on Beans (like coffee beans, or bean counting -- Very unclever, I know) in the hopes that it helps us budget and I can also distribute it as freeware to students at my University, such that their budgeting is made simple, free of charge (because students are on average broke).
